# Apple [Solo Project]
A clone of an Apple's website illustrating the use of background images and gradients for elements' background

> This project consists of building an HTML page that matches the appearance of an old version of Apple's presesentation page. Gradient is used for the navigation bar and background images are set to the body of the html and the promotional panels at the bottom. Additionally the like-header text elements in the middle of the page are implemented using images downloaded from Apple's archive github
